- 👋 Hi, I’m Travis
- 👀 I’m a little bit of a lot of things - coffee nerd, foodie, small time adrenaline junkie, trail runner, reader, and more. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, mainly, but also some SAS because of my day job; while also trying to improve my SQL skills, and all along knowing I should probably just be learning Python...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything?
- 📫 How to reach me ...
